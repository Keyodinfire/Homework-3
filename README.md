# Homework 3
Hello Github!


In this README.md I will show that I have completed my HW 3. 
The website used to complete much of HW 3 is located [here](https://learngitbranching.js.org/).
On this website, I went through many different instances of using Git commands to copy and move commits around.
Some of the commands I used were *$git rebase*, which let me copy over certain commits to a different location, and *$git commit --amend*, which let me copy the most recent commit to a new location.
The command *$git branch* let me move commit references around. 
The command *$git checkout* made the specified commit reference the HEAD of the changes. 

Also found in this repo is an image file, which is a screenshot showing that I have completed each specified task.
Also found in this repo, in the Issues tab, is an issue, that is a to-do list for this homework assignment.
